**Project Overview:**

Firewall Commander is a real-time tower defense game developed with TypeScript, Yarn, Phaser, Vite, and Electron. The player assumes the role of a cybersecurity specialist tasked with managing a network's defenses. Using strategic firewall placement and management, the player must keep the network safe from a range of cyber threats. Gameplay elements include an upgradeable tower system, various enemy types, an interactive game economy, and a wave-based progression system.

**Inspirations:**

- [Kingdom Rush](https://www.kingdomrush.com/)
- [Bloons TD 6](https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Tower-Defense/Play/Bloons-TD-6.html)
- [Plants vs Zombies](https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies)

**Key Tech Stack:**

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

**Design Considerations:**

The game will be developed using TypeScript for type safety and improved developer productivity. Yarn is used for package management. Phaser will serve as the game engine, providing a robust and flexible platform for creating HTML5 games. Vite will be used for its fast and lean build system, and Electron will enable the game to be packaged as a desktop application. We'll follow best practices for clean code and architecture, with an emphasis on modular, reusable components.

**Additional Tools and Libraries:**

- [Mitt](https://github.com/developit/mitt)
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) for level design

**File Handling:**

All scripts, assets, and configuration files will be managed through Git version control on GitHub. For script editing, we will use an IDE such as JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.
